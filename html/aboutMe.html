            How I got introduced:
        </h1>
    </center>
    <p>I was first introduced to programming when I was in the 7th grade. My dad was starting a company and needed
        to learn programming, so he could talk to his programmer easier. He thought, well if i'm learning a new
        language right now
        I can teach my son that language.</p>

    <p>The language ended up being javascript. I got to work with my dad and started making landing pages that would
        help my siblings study for their tests.</p>

    <p>Later on in life, I started working for my dad making landing pages for his website that followed an ad. I
        had
        to make sure the site had scent and the 10 quintessential things a landing page needs. </p>

    <p>Eventually I got better and better and thought, why don't I really go into this? So, I applied to MATC and
        got in.</p>

    <p>There I got taught by Xatcware's employees. Which I personally thought was great because that meant I was
        getting
        information that really mattered, not some guy reading out of a textbook. So when you work with me you know
        i'll know the newest and best content, because I was taught the newest and best content by Xactware
        employees.</p>

        I love to go fishing, I got somewhere awesome every year. To the left of me is a picture of a 126 pound sturgeon. I caught that fish on the columbia. Now this fish
        was the dinker of the family fishing day. It was my biggest, but my sister caught a 523 pound sturgeon that same day. These fish are as big as the boat and are as freaky
        looking as a sturgeon.
